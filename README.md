# Snake-Game
Here is an interactive game I have coded using some modules of Python. Understanding this code will help you exploring Python and give you an idea of 2-D game coding.  
This is a simple snake game that you can play using arrow keys to move your snake
In this code I have also used fonts and text to make it more look like a game not just a window, although i haven't added sprites in my code this repository is public so if anyone want to do the job for us then he/she is most welcome :)
